=================================

1. Header and source files
	Each class is separated into two files: header file with .hpp extension, and implementation file with .cpp extension. Exception are small
	classes which can be easly implemented in header file.


	Header file must use "guard lines" to prevent multiple including of headers into binary program. This guard lines are defined as follows:

	#ifndef __<CLASS_NAME>_HPP__
	#define __<CLASS_NAME>_HPP__

	... [class definition]

	#endif // __<CLASS_NAME>_HPP__

	Class are named with additional 'C' prefix (like 'C'lass). This name is also used for filenames. So for example CDirector class has its 
	definition in CDirector.hpp file and implementation in CDirector.cpp file.

2. Spacing
	Editor must be set to use tab character with size of 4 spaces.


3. Loops and conditional statements
